# tech-test-frontend

This contains a very basic frontend application. It uses a Javascript library to generates a CSS file from SCSS.

## Usage

To install the necessary packages:

```
yarn install
```

To generate the CSS file:

```
yarn build
```

The CSS file will be generated in `public/main.css`

You will need to do something with `main.css` in the other part of the test.
